WTF:
Pls explain the “perks” from owning the nfts
- all the NFTs give 10% earnings bonus, as shown in the visual mockup

Since y’all probably did not intend for this game to take literal years, please elaborate on the time frame you want the AP"Y" and AP"R" to take place over
- everything should be APR, daily profit = APR / 365, 

NFTs- Will they be programmatically generated using the assets in the ‘NFT’ folder? If not, how are these assets to be used?
- it says this in the plan, but the NFTs will be generated by using different combinations of the component images, which can be done via a program or manually

What happens if you run out of money? can you have a negative balance in either the wallet or cryptos?
- crypto value can't physically go below $0, but as with real life, your balance can go negative (aka debt)

What is the significance of your repeated usage of the numbers 69 and 420? please explain in an essay of 500-600 words
- your mom lol

There do not seem to be any NFT images of the type demonstrated (memes, people) within your folders, should we create more of those types or of the simple designs contained within the folders?
- these are obviously placeholders, but we added some other pics to a "finished NFTs" folder if that floats your boat
